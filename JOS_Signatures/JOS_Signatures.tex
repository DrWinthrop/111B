\begin{enumerate}

    \item What is a Josephson Junction?
    
    \item What is a Cooper Pair?

    \item How does the DC Josephson effect work? What is the AC Josephson effect? How are they useful?

    \item Why is it important to know the number 2e/h; what does it mean?

    \item How do you construct the Josephson Junction used in this experiment? (Hint 4 wire junction)

    \item Explain how you remove the junction assembly from the probe and put it back in.

\begin{enumerate}

    \item On day 3 of this lab, show your photo of the DC effect with calibrated axis and photo of the AC effect, with calibrated axis, to a GSI. Also you present your measured corrected value for 2$e/h$ in units of Hz/V (2$e/h= 4.83593718 \times 10^{14}$), with uncertainty, to an instructor and ask for a signature.
