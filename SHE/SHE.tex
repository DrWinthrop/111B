\section{Semiconductor Hall Effect Description (SHE)}

is the average velocity in the direction of an applied electric field of the all conducting charge carriers in the sample.

\textbf{Lorentz force}

is the force, $ \vec{F}=q(\vec{\nu}\times\vec{B}) $ which a moving charge experiences when subjected to a magnetic field. Here, $ \vec{B} $ is the magnetic field, $ \vec{\nu} $ is the velocity of the carrier, and $q$ its charge.
