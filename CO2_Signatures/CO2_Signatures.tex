\begin{enumerate}

    \item How does a laser work, in general?
    
    \item What is the purpose of the different gases ( i.e. $N_2$, $CO_2$, and He)?

    \item What are the necessary characteristics of the medium, and the cavity?

    \item How are the practical requirements for laser action satisfied in a CO2 laser in this lab?

    \item What does a grating do when one is used in place of a mirror in the laser?

    \item What are the safety requirements for working with this laser?

\begin{enumerate}

    \item On day 4 of this lab, you should have successfully aligned the laser and observed a lasing spectrum in the spectrum analyzer. How many lines are lasing? On what does this number depend? Demonstrate your progress to an instructor and ask for a signature.
